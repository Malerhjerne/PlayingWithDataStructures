 * ------- Extra challenge -------

You come across a farmer, who got stuck in a mineshaft. His eyes are hurt, so he is hardly able to see, and since you are above him, you can see the area around him. 
A lot of dangerous traps are going crazy down there, but from your position you can see a pattern in the traps.
(Like, who would place traps in a mine? And who would make them trigger in a recognizable pattern?!).

You want to help the farmer, but he must hurry, so you must tell him the order to move.

The order is:



East -> South -> East -> East -> North -> North -> North -> West -> North -> North -> East -> East -> East -> South -> East



How would you save this information in code? What data structure can be used for this?



HINT: You can use the enum with directions.
